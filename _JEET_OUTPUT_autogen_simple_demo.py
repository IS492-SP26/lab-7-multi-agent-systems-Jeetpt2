AutoGen GroupChat Demo - Interview Platform Product Planning

This demonstrates REAL multi-agent collaboration using AutoGen's GroupChat,
where agents converse with each other, respond to each other's contributions,
and the GroupChatManager orchestrates speaker selection via LLM.

This contrasts with CrewAI's task-based approach — here the agents CHAT
rather than execute isolated tasks.

This workflow demonstrated AutoGen's CONVERSATIONAL approach to multi-agent systems:
- Agents were placed in a GroupChat and communicated naturally
- The GroupChatManager used LLM-based speaker selection (not hardcoded order)
- Agents referenced each other's contributions in their responses
- The conversation emerged organically through agent-to-agent interaction

Compare with CrewAI (crewai/crewai_demo.py):
- CrewAI assigns discrete Tasks to Agents with expected_output
- Each agent works independently on their assigned task
- Output is passed as context to the next task (not conversational)
- Workflow is strictly sequential with no back-and-forth
